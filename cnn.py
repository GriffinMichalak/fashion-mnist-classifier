In this file you will write the model definition for a convolutional neural network. 

Please only complete the model definition and do not include any training code.

The model should be a convolutional neural network, that accepts 28x28 grayscale images as input, and outputs a tensor of size 10.
The number of layers/kernels, kernel sizes and strides are up to you. 

Please refer to the following for more information about convolutions, pooling, and convolutional layers in PyTorch:

    - https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html


Whether you need to normalize outputs using softmax depends on your choice of loss function. PyTorch documentation is available at
https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html, and will specify whether a given loss funciton requires normalized outputs or not.
